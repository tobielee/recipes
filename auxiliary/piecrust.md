# Pie crust

A butter shortcrust pastry (Pâte Brisée/Sucrée); can be used as vessel for savory or sweet fillings

---

Time required: time it takes to get cup of ice cold water and frozen butter (maybe 1h in freezer) + 20-30 mins prep (by hand) + 2 h of letting dough relax in fridge prior to rolling out

Ingredients:
* 2 1/4 c flour sifted (290- 320 g)
* 6-7 g salt for unsalted butter (omit if using salted butter)
* 1 T sugar (for a dessert crust use more sugar e.g. 25 g sugar is what I found works well)
* 7-8 oz (two sticks) butter 
* 6 T ice water (may need more or less)

Procedure:
1. Put a glass of water or bottle of water in freezer (use bottled if tap isn't good)
2. Chop block of butter into small cubes and freeze cubes in bowl
3. Sift flour into clean area/vessel
4. Add sugar and salt to flour and mix
5. Add frozen cubes of butter to dry ingredients, mix and crumble butter
6. Once mixture is crumbly (with crumbles about the same size, add ice cold water 1 or 2 T at a time and mix until dough comes together (dough should not be dry - it takes some practice to know when dough is sufficiently hydrated)
7. Store dough in fridge for a couple hours prior to use. Dough freezes well, so if you have left overs and don't plan on using for a while (> 1 wk) you can freeze
