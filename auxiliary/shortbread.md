# Shortbread

A buttery cake-like biscuit that can be standalone or used to wrap a fruity filling.

---

Time required: time it takes to get room temp butter + 10 mins prep (by hand) + (optional) 20-30 mins resting of dough

Ingredients:
* 130 g unsalted butter (a bit more than a stick)
* Salt to taste (1 g or two pinches)
* 45 g powdered sugar (you can grind granulated sugar to get powdered)
* 30 g powdered milk (this is just dry milk)
* 2 egg yolks
* 160 g cake flour (I think all purpose could work too - cake just offers a more delicate texture)

Procedure:
1. Whip room temp butter and sugar
2. Add egg yolk to butter sugar and mix
3. Add powdered milk to butter sugar and mix
4. Add salt to butter sugar and mix
5. Gradually incorporate flour to butter sugar (I sift it in to ensure no clumpage) and mix to form dough
6. (optional) let rest at fridge or room temp for no more than 30 mins prior to use.
