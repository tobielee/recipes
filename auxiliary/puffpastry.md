# Puff Pastry

Laminated shortcrust, variation on [pie crust](piecrust.md)

---

Time required: time it takes to get cup of ice cold water and frozen butter (maybe 1h in freezer) + 40 mins prep (by hand) + 2 h of letting dough relax in fridge prior to rolling out and perhaps +30 mins during lamination procress

Ingredients:

* 2 1/4 C (290-320 g) flour sifted
* 6-7 g salt for unsalted butter (omit if using salted butter)
* 1 T sugar (for a dessert crust use more sugar e.g. 25 g sugar is what I found works well)
* 7-8 oz (199-227 g or two sticks) butter
* 6 T ice water (may need more or less)

Procedure:
1. Put a glass of water or bottle of water in freezer (use bottled if tap isn't good)
2. Chop half of the butter (one stick) into small cubes and freeze cubes in bowl
3. Roll out other half of butter into a rectangle for lamination (can be done either in a ziplock or sandwhiched in parchment paper) and freeze. 
4. Sift flour onto clean countertop or mixing bowl (this will be used for making dough and light kneading)
5. Add sugar and salt to flour and mix
6. Add frozen cubes of butter to dry ingredients, mix and crumble butter
7. Once mixture is crumbly (with crumbles about the same size, add ice cold water 1 or 2 T at a time and mix until dough comes together (dough should not be dry - it takes some practice to know when dough is sufficiently hydrated)
8. Remove butter rectangle from freezer to allow to thaw (just needs to get to a point where it's not super brittle).
9. Roll out dough large enough to fold over butter rectangle
10. Roll out further, then fold ends toward halfway point and then fold ends together
11. Rotate 90 degrees, roll out and fold ends toward halfway point and then fold ends together
12. Repeat step 11 two or three more times - if dough is not cold you should put it in freezer for 15-20 mins (or fridge for 30 mins) before finishing folds.
13. Store dough in fridge for a couple hours prior to use.
Side note: This dough freezes well, so if you have leftover dough and don't plan on using within a week you can opt to freeze to prolong storage (though I'd still recommend using within 1-2 months when stored frozen).
