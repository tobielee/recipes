# Brioche dough

An enriched bread dough consisting of egg, butter, liquid (e.g. milk) and usually sugar.

 Time required: 15-20 mins

## Ingredients

* 1/2 Cup water or milk
* 1 pkg or 7 g yeast (active dry and instant are both viable options - I haven't tried fresh yeast but I'm sure it'll work too)
* 80 g sugar
* 530 g flour (I like 300 g All-purpose + 230 g Bread)
* 1 stick or 4 oz (114 g) unsalted butter
* 3 g fine salt
* 4 medium eggs (or 3 large eggs + 1 yolk)

## Procedure

1. If using active dry yeast, heat milk/water to 110 F, then combine sugar water yeast. If using instant yeast, no need to dissolve, just add yeast to flour.
2. In separate bowl add flour salt and butter (crumble butter into flour similar to pie crust though ice cold butter but butter should be fridge temp to make this process easier)
3. Add eggs to dough and gradually incorporate liquid
4. Knead dough until tacky but not sticky (at least 10 mins)
5. Butter surface of container (optional but may make retrieval easier) and place dough inside container, wrap with plastic wrap and stick in fridge for at least overnight (>8 h but <48 h); use dough within 48 hours.

Notes: Bulk fermentation is done in fridge though you could let it ferment for a few hours (maybe 4 hours)  at room temp if you want to use dough on same day. I still recommend fridge since it's much easier to work with dough at fridge temp.
