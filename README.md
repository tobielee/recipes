A collection of food recipes with the goal of yielding tasty reproducible results.

## Kitchen equipment I use for these recipes:
* Cast iron skillet (8 or 9 inch diameter)
* Chef's knife (8 or 9 inch)
* Paring knife (90 mm or 3.5 inch)
* Cutting board (can be a cheapo, but I also like thick end grain maple)
* Stainless (18/8 or 18/10) flatware (at least one tablespoon, teaspoon, butter knife, and fork)
* Enameled dutch oven (7.25 qt - I think anything at least 4 qt is fine)
* Balance/scale (to measure ingredients to nearest gram)
* Glass 2-cup liquid measuring cup
* Ceramic bowls and plates + tupperware containers/glass jars for storing materials
* Aluminum half sheet pan + cooling rack 
* Muffin tin (optional - good if you like small baked treats)
* Colander (makes washing vegetables easier)
* Stainless fine-mesh strainer/sieve
* Stainless microplane/grater
* Large stainless mixing bowls (standard small/med/large set should be fine)
* Spatula (I like stainless slotted fish turner)
* Large (wooden) spoon (e.g. maple with at least 12 inch handle)
* Tongs (at least 6 inch)
* Chopsticks
* Kitchen towels (keep one exclusively for wiping up messes)
* Large mortar and pestle (yeah you can use a blender)
* Rolling pin (optional - could just use a wine bottle)
* Thermometer/temp probe (optional - though it is helpful for reproducibility)
* Small 2 inch flat brush (makes applying eggwash so much easier than with a spoon)

Note: unless otherwise indicated, my recipes are optimized for oven and stove/range cooking.

### What of other pots/pans?
I like the cast iron/dutch oven combo since they can go from stovetop to oven and heat distribution fairly even, which is good for baking. This combo pretty much covers majority of cooking feats, though it would be nice to have a small stainless saucepan and, less essential, a large aluminum stockpot. If you have a gas range, carbon woks would be awesome for stirfry but not everyone has a gas range.
