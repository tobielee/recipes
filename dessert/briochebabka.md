# Twisted Brioche Rolls/Buns (variation on Babka)

A sweet braided yeast-leavened bread, usually with some filling. Fillings I have included in this recipe are chocolate and cinnamon sugar; you may design your own filling as well (I just like chocolate and cinnamon sugar). Inspired by Jewish, Central/Eastern European Babka - though I'm using brioche base instead of challah.

## Ingredients

##### Bread
[Brioche](../auxiliary/brioche.md)

##### Filling options

###### Chocolate paste
* 1 bar (113-115 g) 60-70% cacao dark chocolate 
* 1 stick or 4 oz (114 g) salted butter (can do unsalted and adjust for salt but salted makes it easier)
* 1 Tablespoon milk (could use water or your favorite liquer)
* 70 g confectioners sugar
* 30 g cocoa powder 
* Salt to taste (you'll need a few pinches if using unsalted butter)

###### Cinnamon sugar paste
* 1 stick or 4 oz (114 g) salted butter (can do unsalted and adjust for salt but salted makes it easier)
* 7 g cinnamon
* 150 g dark brown sugar (light brown also works)
* Salt to taste (you'll need a few pinches if using unsalted butter)


##### Sugar glaze (simple syrup)
* 72 g sugar
* 1/3 Cup or 80 g water 

## Procedure

##### Make your filling (paste)
###### Chocolate paste
1. Use double boiler method to melt the dark chocolate bar. Add stick of butter to melted chocolate. Then at tablespoon of liquid.  
2. Mix cocoa powder and confectioners suger in separate bowl, then combine with chocolate butter. Salt to taste (go by the pinch). 
###### Cinnamon sugar paste
1. Get butter to room temp. Mix brown sugar and cinnamon in a bowl. 
2. Mix in room temp butter to cinnamon sugar to make paste. Salt to taste (go by the pinch).

##### Prepare twisted rolls for muffin tin
3. When ready to bake, roll out dough, spread paste to edge (ok if not all the way), then fold in thirds (like letter)
4. Use cold floured knife to cut portions
5. Make two additional cuts in rectangular portions length wise and braid at least two turns before rolling onto itself and placing in muffin tin
6. Allow dough to proof while you preheat oven to 350 F (30 mins should be enough). 

Note: For a more traditional babka, you would roll the dough (instead of folding in thirds) and cut the dough in half both widthwise and lengthwise (for two loaves). You will take two portions and braid to form one loaf. Bake time will likely be on the longer side i.e. 30 -45 mins? (I actually haven't done this myself). 

##### Bake
6. Bake at 350 F for 25-30 min for muffin tin sized rolls (while baking you can prepare sugar glaze which requires hot water to dissolve sugar)
7. Brush on sugar glaze immediately after baking and set to rest for 5-10 mins. 
8. Remove pastries from muffin tin, and rest for another 5-10 mins on rack.
