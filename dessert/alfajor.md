## Alfajor 

Time required: Overnight incubation, ~20 min prep, ~15 min bake  

Ingredients:
* Dulce de leche - just need aliquot from a store bought can or from homemade above
* 1 teaspoon/2 grams finely grated lemon (zest of two small lemons)
* 1 tablespoon vanilla 
* 1 tablespoon brandy/some hard liquor or another tablespoon vanilla
* 100 g all-purpose flour 
* 120 g potato starch
* 3 g baking powder 
* <1 g fine sea salt (maybe just a pinch)
* 80 g granulated sugar 
* 160 g unsalted butter (about 1.5 sticks) at room temperature 
* 2 egg yolks 

Procedure: 
1. In a small bowl, combine brandy (vanilla), lemon zest and 1 tablespoon vanilla
2. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt.
3. In another large bowl, beat sugar and butter until light and fluffy. Add yolks and beat to combine, then add brandy/vanilla zest and mix thoroughly. Add flour mixture, and mix until dough just comes together (try to avoid overmixing)

Note: dough can be a bit wet but should firm up after storing in fridge. If after still somewhat wet after chilling in fridge, flour surfaces during partitioning of dough prior to bake.

4. Divide the dough in half and roll each piece into a log about 1½ inches thick. Wrap in plastic and chill until firm, at least 2 hours (overnight is better).

5. Preheat oven 350F
######  Options for partitioning dough and baking 
Note: It is advised to err on smaller size as these things have loads of sugar

6.1. Make sure dough logs are cold; thinly slice log and create sandwiches halves, can form final state with dulce de leche prior or after bake (spread with whatever or pipe in if you want to be fancy) - bake 7-10 mins on parchment paper lined baking sheet (can bake both sides if crispier texture desired)

6.2. Just roll out dough and use a small cutter to cut out traditional cookies - bake 10-12 mins on parchment paper lined baking sheet - (recommended to add dulce de leche after bake for this option)

7. Let cool on rack
8. Add dulce de leche filling if not present
9. Store in airtight container if not consuming
