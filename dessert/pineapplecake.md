## Ingredients 
(amount should yield enough for about 9 cakes in a standard muffin tin)

##### Crust/shell
* [Shortbread](../auxiliary/shortbread.md)

Note this shortbread is probably a bit too delicate - may need to use all-purpose flour or knead the dough (or incorporate some egg white) for more structure or just extend bake time by a couple mins?

##### Filling
* 1 pineapple (750-800 g pineapple)
* 20 g sugar
* 3 large scoops of maltose with tablespoon (probably close to 4 or 5 tablespoons) 

If you don't have maltose, substitute 20 g sugar + 3 scoops maltose with 50 g white sugar + 30 g brown sugar. Please feel free to adjust sugar content since pineapples may vary in degree of sweetness. This is recipe does give added benefit if you happened to pick a sour pineapple. 

## Procedure

I would prepare the pineapple filling first as that can remain in the fridge for a week if need be. The dough for shell should always be prepared when you want to bake. 

#### Pineapple preparation
1. Cut and core pineapple. You can weigh the pieces to ensure you have enough (you don't have to use all of the pineapple for this). Then finely chop pineapple.
2. Cook pineapple in nonreactive cooking vessel (I like enameled dutch oven but I think stainless should work too). 
3. When majority of liquid has evaporated and pineapple is looking golden brown, add 3 heaping scoops of maltose and sugar (adjust as needed). 
4. After reduced to thick syrup and paste, set pineapple aside to cool and put in fridge for at least a couple hours (can do overnight up to 1 week).
5. When ready to bake form 25-30 g balls. 

#### Prepping pastry
6. Make [Shortbread](../auxiliary/shortbread.md) 
7. Roll up 40 g balls of dough and set aside in fridge or at room temp for at most 30 mins
8. Mold dough ball around pineapple ball and place into muffin tin (light palm over to flatten top)

#### Bake
8. Bake 350 F for 12-15 mins then flip and bake 5-8 mins
9. Cool on rack for 10 mins then place in air tight container and let rest for 24 h at room temp. You could probably speed this process up by sticking in fridge.
